 1. What is a Function?

  A function in JavaScript is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task.
 Functions help you structure your code, making it modular, maintainable, and reusable.

Types of Functions in JavaScript?
-Normal Function
-Annonymous Function
-Arrow Function
-IIFE(Immediatly Invoked Function Expression)
-HOF(Higher Order Function)

  1.Normal Function:
     A function declared with the function keyword.
  2.Annonymous Function:
      In a function expression, a function is assigned to a variable. This allows functions to be
 anonymous (without a name).
  3.Arrow Function:
       Introduced in ES6, arrow functions provide a shorter syntax and are often used for writing small
 functions.
  4.IIFE Function:
      An IIFE is a function that is executed immediately after it is defined. It is often used to avoid
 polluting the global scope.
  5.HOF Function:
      A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a
 function as a result.
  // Single Threated Synchronous language excute line by line.
  // Single Threated Asynchronous language excute jump next line before 1st line excute

2. If Else - Condition?

 JavaScript are used to execute different blocks
 of code based on different conditions. They are fundamental to
 controlling the flow of a program.

 If-Else Ladder?

  The  if-else ladder is used when you need to check
 multiple conditions. It allows you to test several conditions in
 sequence.

 // Ternary Oprator(Shorthand IF-Else)?

  The ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing an if-else
 statement. It takes three operands: a condition, an expression to
 execute if the condition is true, and an expression to execute if
 the condition is false.

  // Swith Case?
    The switch statement is an alternative to multiple if-else if
 statements. It compares the value of a variable against multiple
 cases and executes the corresponding block of code.

 3. While Loop?
 ● The while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as
 long as a specified condition is true.
 ● Before each iteration, the condition is checked. If the condition
 is true, the code block is executed. If the condition is false,
 the loop stops.

 //Do-While Loop?
 ● The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but with one key
 difference: the code block is executed at least once before the
 condition is tested.
 ● The condition is checked after the code block has executed, so
 the loop runs at least once, even if the condition is false
 initially.

 // For-loop?
  The for loop is one of the most commonly used loops in JavaScript. It
 is designed to execute a block of code a specific number of times,
 making it ideal for scenarios where you know in advance how many times
 you want to iterate.
