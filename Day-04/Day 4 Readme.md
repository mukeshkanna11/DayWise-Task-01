//Hoisting & Scope?

1. Hoisting:
 ● Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are
 moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase before the code is
 executed.
 ● Thismeans that you can use variables and functions before they are declared in the
 code.

 2. Scope:
 ● Scoperefers to the accessibility of variables and functions in different parts of your
 code.
 ● JavaScript has a Global Scope and Local Scope (function or block scope).

 Global Scope:
 ● Variables declared outside any function or block are in the global scope, accessible from
 anywhere in the code.

 Local Scope:
 ● Variables declared inside a function are in the local scope and can only be accessed
 within that function.

 //Arrays & Array Methods in JavaScript?

 1. Arrays:
 ● Anarrayis a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
 ● Arrays can store multiple values in a single variable, and each value is accessed using
 an index.

 2. Common Array Methods:
  push() and pop(): Add or remove elements from the end of an array.

  shift() and unshift(): Add or remove elements from the beginning of an array.

  slice() and splice(): Extract or modify parts of an array.

  map(): Creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the array.

  filter(): Creates a new array with elements that pass a test defined in a function.
  javascript.

  forEach(): Executes a provided function once for each array element.

  //Object and JSON Iteration in JavaScript?

JSON OVER ITERATION:

● Iterating over JSON data in JavaScript is a common task,
 especially when dealing with API responses or configuration data.
 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is typically represented as an
 object or array of objects.
 ● Let's explore how to iterate over JSON data using an example.
